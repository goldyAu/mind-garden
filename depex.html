            <h1>Major Depression Disorder</h1>
            <p>Major depression is a severe mental health condition characterized by a persistent and overwhelming sense of sadness that affects daily life. People with this condition often lose interest in activities they once enjoyed and may feel detached from the world around them. It can lead to physical symptoms such as changes in sleep, appetite, and energy levels, as well as difficulty concentrating or making decisions. While the exact causes vary, factors such as genetics, brain chemistry, and life stressors often play a role. With proper treatment, including therapy, medication, and support, recovery is possible.</p>

            <h1>Persistent Depressive Disorder</h1>
            <p>Also known as dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder is a chronic form of depression lasting for at least two years. Individuals with this condition often experience milder symptoms compared to major depression but still struggle with feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, and hopelessness. While the symptoms may not be as intense, they are persistent and can interfere with daily life and relationships over time. People with this disorder may also have periods of more severe depressive episodes within the ongoing symptoms. Treatment through therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes can help manage the condition and improve quality of life.</p>

            <h1>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder</h1>
            <p>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is a condition characterized by frequent temper outbursts and chronic irritability in children. These outbursts are often intense and disproportionate to the situation, occurring multiple times a week. Between episodes, children with DMDD may remain irritable or angry most of the time. Symptoms typically begin before the age of ten, significantly impacting social, academic, and family life. Early diagnosis and treatment, such as therapy and behavioral interventions, are crucial for managing the disorder and improving outcomes.</p>

            <h1>Postpartum Depression</h1>
            <p>Some women experience a brief period of sadness or heightened emotions after giving birth, commonly known as the "baby blues," which usually resolves within a few days to weeks. However, postpartum depression is more severe and can persist for months or even years. This condition may include feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, and difficulty bonding with the baby, significantly affecting a motherâ€™s well-being. While its exact cause is unknown, it is believed to result from hormonal changes, stress, and other factors. Early intervention through therapy, support groups, and medical treatment can help mothers recover and regain emotional balance.</p>

            <h1>Seasonal Affective Disorder</h1>
            <p>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that typically arises during the fall and winter months when daylight hours are shorter. People with SAD often experience symptoms such as low energy, sadness, and difficulty concentrating, which improve with the arrival of spring and summer. The lack of sunlight is believed to disrupt the body's internal clock and lower serotonin levels, contributing to the condition. Light therapy, increased exposure to natural light, and other treatments can help alleviate symptoms. Recognizing the seasonal pattern of SAD is key to managing its effects effectively.</p>

            <h1>Psychotherapy</h1>
            <p>Therapy involves working with a mental health professional to address emotional and psychological challenges. Your therapist helps you identify and change negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that may be affecting your well-being. One of the most common and effective forms of therapy is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The duration of therapy can vary, ranging from short-term sessions to ongoing support over months or years. Engaging in therapy provides tools and strategies to improve mental health and enhance overall quality of life.</p>

            <h1>Medication</h1>
            <p>Antidepressants are prescription medicines designed to alter brain chemistry and alleviate depression. There are several types of antidepressants, each working differently to address symptoms. While effective for many, these medications can sometimes cause side effects. Most side effects are mild and tend to improve over time as the body adjusts. It’s important to consult a healthcare provider to find the most suitable treatment and manage any concerns.</p>

            <h1>Complementary Medicine</h1>
            <p>Complementary therapies can be beneficial alongside conventional Western medicine. Options such as acupuncture, massage, hypnosis, and biofeedback are often used to support mental health. These approaches may be particularly helpful for individuals with mild depression or recurring symptoms. They aim to enhance overall well-being and may provide relief from emotional or physical stress. Consulting with a healthcare provider ensures these therapies are integrated safely and effectively.</p>

            <h1>Brain Stimulation Therapy</h1>
            <p>Brain stimulation therapy can be beneficial for individuals with severe depression or depression accompanied by psychosis. This treatment involves using various techniques to stimulate specific areas of the brain. Common forms include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Each method works differently but aims to alleviate symptoms by altering brain activity. These therapies are typically considered when other treatments, such as medication or psychotherapy, have been ineffective.</p>

            <h1>Prevention</h1>
            <p>Depression can’t always be prevented, but certain lifestyle choices can help reduce your risk. Maintaining a healthy sleep routine is essential for emotional well-being. Managing stress through healthy coping mechanisms can provide resilience against negative emotions. Regular self-care activities like exercise, meditation, and yoga can boost your mood and overall mental health. Additionally, eating a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, and staying connected with friends and family can help mitigate feelings of isolation and support mental stability.</p>

        <h1>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h1>
        <p>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterized by excessive, persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Unlike normal anxiety, the worries in GAD are often disproportionate to the actual events and are difficult to control. People with GAD may experience physical symptoms such as fatigue, muscle tension, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping. This condition can significantly impact daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. Treatment often includes therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes to manage symptoms effectively.</p>

        <h1>Social Anxiety</h1>
        <p>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) is a mental health condition characterized by an intense fear of social situations where one might be judged, embarrassed, or scrutinized. People with social anxiety often worry excessively about saying or doing something wrong, leading to avoidance of social interactions or performance situations. Common symptoms include blushing, sweating, trembling, a rapid heart rate, and difficulty speaking in social settings. This condition can interfere with work, school, and relationships, significantly impacting quality of life. Treatment options include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, and gradual exposure to feared situations to reduce anxiety over time.</p>

        <h1>Panic Attacks</h1>
        <p>Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and can occur unexpectedly or in response to a trigger. They are often accompanied by physical symptoms such as a racing heart, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating, or trembling, which may be mistaken for a heart attack. Emotional symptoms include a fear of losing control, going crazy, or even dying. Panic attacks can be a one-time occurrence or part of a broader condition like Panic Disorder, where they recur frequently and cause ongoing fear of future episodes. Treatment typically includes therapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication, and learning coping strategies like deep breathing or grounding techniques.</p>

        <h1>Phobias</h1>
        <p>Phobias are intense, irrational fears of specific objects, situations, or activities that are typically avoided or endured with extreme anxiety. Unlike general anxiety, phobias are focused on a particular trigger, such as heights, spiders, or flying. Common types of phobias include specific phobias (fear of certain objects or situations), social phobia (fear of social interactions), and agoraphobia (fear of being in situations where escape is difficult or help unavailable). The anxiety caused by phobias can interfere with daily life, leading to avoidance behaviors that limit personal freedom. Treatment often involves exposure therapy, where individuals gradually face their fear in a controlled, safe manner, and sometimes medication to help manage symptoms.</p>
